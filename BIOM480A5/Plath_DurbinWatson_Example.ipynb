    "# The Durbin-Watson Statistical Test #\n",
    "### The Durbin-Watson test is used to assess if there is autocorrelation among the residuals (errors) in a regression modelâ€™s output. Autocorrelation represents the degree of similarity between a signal and a delayed version of itself. DW values range from 0 - 4, which 2 meaning no autocorrelation. A DW value below 2 indicates that there is positive autocorrelation. A DW value above 2 indicates that there is negative autocorrelation. These terms will be explained by Figure 2, below.\n",

    "### The figure above demonstrates the difference between positive and negative autocorrelation. Positive autocorrelation is present when the error of a sign is mostly followed by an error of the same sign. In this example, you can see that a majority of the positive points are followed by more positive points. Negative autocorrelation is present when the error of a specific sign is mostly followed by an error of the opposite sign. In this example, you can see that each point alternates between positive and negative errors. \n",

    "### The Durbin-Watson test is commonly used in econometrics to determine if there is a momentum factor that impacts a specific stock that someone is looking at. The test could be used to analyze the relationship between stock returns and different factors like interest rates and inflation effects. If the Durbin-Watson test returned positive autocorrelation (0 < DW < 2), it would suggest that momentum may exist in that specific stock because the past stock returns influence future stock returns. Knowing this information, they could use momentum-based trading skills which rely on buying rising stocks and selling falling stocks. If the Durbin-Watson test returned negative autocorrelation (2 < DW < 4), it would suggest that stocks vary between rising and falling by the day. Typically, this would lead to mean-reversion strategies which rely on underperforming stocks to rise. If the Durbin-Watson test returned no autocorrelation (DW = 2), it would suggest that the stock rises and falls somewhat unpredictable and a more advanced tactic/test would have to be used to predict patterns of that stock."
